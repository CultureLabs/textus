![Textus: an open source platform for collaborating around collections of texts](images/textus_logo.jpg)

Textus is an **open source** platform for working with collections of texts. It enables students, researchers and teachers to **share** and **collaborate** around texts using a simple and intuitive interface.

## What does Textus do?
Textus currently enables users to:

* Collaboratively annotate texts and view the annotations of others
* Reliably cite electronic versions of texts
* Create bibliographies with stable URLs to online versions of those texts

## Where has Textus been deployed?
The first instance of Textus will be deployed as [beta.OpenPhilosophy.org](http://beta.openphilosophy.org/). We are working closely with students from [Goldsmiths University](http://www.gold.ac.uk/), the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/) and a distinguished advisory board of philosophy academics to make sure that OpenPhilosophy meets the needs of the philosophical community.

We are also in the process of upgrading [Open Literature][lit] to use Textus.

## The Textus 'Standard'

At the core of Textus is a lightweight standard for how to store texts. The
software components of Textus build around this lightweight standard.

You can find full documentation of the standard in the [Textus JSON Format
specification][format].

### Additional related documentation

Note: much of this is in the process of becoming obsolete due to the move to a
new componentized model (see slides) and will be updated or removed in the near
future.

## Components

The Textus Platform is now being refactored composed of 4 separate components:

* [Textus Formatter][formatter] - this tool converts standard text formats to the Textus
  format
* [Textus Viewer][viewer] - this is a pure Javascript + HTML app that displays a text in
  Textus Format
* [Textus Wordpress][wordpress] - a plugin that uses the other Textus tools to turn
  Wordpress into a platform for hosting, presenting and collaborating on
  cultural texts
* [Textus API][api-component] - create an API for texts in Textus format

Note these components are under **active development** as of December 2013.
