On Tuesday the TEXTUS team trouped North to the Cambridge University Philosophy Department Casimir Lewy Library.

MPhil students, PhD students, librarians and Professor Derek Matravers who sits on the OpenPhilosophy.org Advisory Board gave their feedback on the demo of TEXTUS currently running at [beta.openphilosophy.org](http://beta.openphilosophy.org/) (do try it yourself!)

As well as feedback on the three key areas of functionality under evaluation, participants engaged in general discussion about possible use cases of TEXTUS and how they might want to use OpenPhilosophy.org in their teaching and research.

## Reading

* Introduce the possibility of toggling between scrolling and paginated view;
* Put page forward and back buttons in the middle of the page.

## Annotation

* Enable moving of annotation writing box;
* The possibility of moving the start and end pointers of where you have annotated;
* Suggestion that annotation should show a date-stamp;
* Should be a different viewer for writing annotations such as translations;
* Should be an option to review your annotations before they are confirmed so that you can check for spelling mistakes etc.

## Importing

* Suggestion that certain metadata fields should be made mandatory;
* There should be a manual to hand, perhaps via “Help” button, when you import a text that gives you mark-up instructions.

## Other points discussed

There was an extensive discussion on the solution that the TEXTUS team came up with concerning the ability to edit annotations.

Given that we want people to be able to cite annotations that they can be sure will not change (much as you would cite a printed publication) allowing users to edit their annotations can be problematic.

Our solution to this is to allow people to flag annotations as “Provisional” or “Final”. If tagged as Provisional they would be editable, if tagged as “Final” they would be permanent.

Some members of the group were concerned that this would mean no one ever flagged their annotations as “Final”. An alternative solution was suggested: users would not be able to edit annotations but would be able to update version of annotations. The most recent versions of an annotation would be the most visible if you filtered for the annotations of a given user on a particular section of text, but previous annotations will still be discoverable in case they had been referred to.

## Going forward
In the coming days we will be incorporating the feedback we have received at Cambridge and [King’s College London](http://textusproject.org/2012/06/26/user-testing-workshop-at-kings-college-london/) into our [user stories](http://wiki.okfn.org/Projects/Textus#User_stories) and continuing discussions with all involved on the [Open Humanities mailing list](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-humanities).
